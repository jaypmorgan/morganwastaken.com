## Abstract

Icons are used everywhere in modern life, but how well do we understand them? In this work, I worked with [Irene Reppa](https://irenereppa.co.uk) of Psychology, Swansea University, to create new normative studies to find out how well people of different diversities and cultures understand icons. Using this information, we device Machine Learning algorithms to learn from them.
