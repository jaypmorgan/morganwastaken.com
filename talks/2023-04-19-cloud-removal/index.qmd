## Abstract

All ground based observatories face a same problem: images may be polluted by terrestrial clouds. These clouds are often thin, due to no observations being usually performed in case of thick clouds. We propose a new method to remove these cloud shadows, based on deep learning and recover the underlying solar features.

This work follows from our published [source code](https://github.com/jaypmorgan/cloud-removal).
