Like in the [pear exercise](../2025-01-08-pear/index), I am simplifying the object of studyâ€“in form and in value. The first attempt is on top, while bottom is the second attempt. In the second version, I spent a lot more time on getting the proportion correct. I think slowing down here was more successful.
