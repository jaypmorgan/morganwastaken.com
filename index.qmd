Hello, my name is Jay Paul Morgan. I am a tutor in Computer Science at [Swansea
University](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/staff/j.p.morgan/). My research focuses on the integration of domain knowledge into
the design of deep neural networks.

I conducted my post-doc research as part of the the [LIS/DYNI](https://www.lis-lab.fr/dyni/) lab in the
[University of Toulon](https://www.univ-tln.fr/-University-of-Toulon-.html).
