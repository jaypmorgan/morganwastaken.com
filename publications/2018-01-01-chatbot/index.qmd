# Abstract

This paper presents a novel method to address legal rights for children through a chatbot framework by integrating machine learning, a dialogue graph, and information extraction. The method addresses a significant problem: we cannot presume that children have common knowledge about their rights or express themselves as an adult might. In our framework, a chatbot user begins a conversation, where based on the circumstance described, a neural network predicts both speech acts, relating to a dialogue graph, and legal types. Information is extracted in order to create a case for a legal advisor. In collaboration with the Children's Legal Centre Wales, who advocate for the improvement of legal rights in Wales, a corpus has been constructed and a prototype chatbot developed. The framework has been evaluated with classification measures and a user study.
