# Abstract

The acoustic repertoires of long-finned pilot whales
(Globicephala melas) in the Mediterranean Sea are poorly
understood. This study aims to create a catalogue of calls,
analyse acoustic parameters, and propose a classification tree
for future research. An acoustic database was compiled using
recordings from the Alboran Sea, Gulf of Lion and Ligurian
Sea (Western Mediterranean Basin) between 2008 and 2022,
totalling 640 calls. Using a deep neural network, the calls were
clustered based on frequency contour similarities, leading to
the identification of 40 distinct call types defining the local
population’s vocal repertoire. These categories encompass
pulsed calls with varied complexities, from simplistic to
highly intricate structures comprising multiple elements
and segments. This study marks the initial documentation
of the vocal catalogue of long-finned pilot whales in the
Mediterranean Sea. Subsequent research should delve deeper
into this multifaceted communication system and explore its
potential linkages with social structures.
