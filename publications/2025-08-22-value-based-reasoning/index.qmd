# Abstract

With the increasing presence and integration of technology in our
society, they are more frequently involved in fundamental decisions that
have a significant impact on us. It is only natural that, if decisions
will be automated by technology, we would wish to guarantee they are
optimally good and well-behaved according to ethical (moral, value,
deontic) requirements. One approach which seeks to integrate values
within the decision process is called Value-based Reasoning. In this
study, we conduct a systematic review of the literature on Value-based
Reasoning to gain a clear understanding of the broader landscape of this
field and to determine its future direction.
