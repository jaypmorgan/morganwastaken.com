We'll be presenting a poster at the [Machine Learning and Computer
Vision in Heliophysics international workshop](https://mosaiics.astro.bas.bg/?page_id=165), Sofia, Bulgaria.

The poster concerns the our work on improving the down-stream feature
detection of solar features by removing the contamination of clouds
from ground-based observations. We've started to open-source our
[program code on github](https://github.com/jaypmorgan/cloud-removal), but please come and ask some questions if
you're at the conference!
