To put it simply: I don't. I don't like the word utilise. Instead, I /use/ the word use. It's a great word, use, it's very shortâ€”one syllable, and easily conveys the intention. While utilise can also convey the meaning, it's wrapped up in this air of pretentiousness that just isn't needed.

I don't utilise the word utilise, I use the word use.
